Flag used In Exim MTA
========
<=	Indicates the arrival of a message to Exim for handling
=>	Shows a normal message delivery
->	Additional address for the same delivery, i.e. an Email forwarder.
>>	cutthrough is a router precondition
        This option requests delivery be attempted while the item is being received. It is usable in the RCPT ACL and valid only for single-recipient mails forwarded from one SMTP connection to another. If a recipient-verify callout connection is requested in the same ACL it is held open and used for the data, otherwise one is made after the ACL completes.
*>	delivery suppressed by -N
**	delivery failed; address bounced
==	delivery deferred; temporary problem
<>	For "<>" from the exim manual; Additionally, you will often find A bounce message is shown with the sender address “<>”, and if it is locally generated, this is followed by an item of the form
R=<message id>
